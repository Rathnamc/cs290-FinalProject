A Final project for Web Development.
This site utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, mySQL ,and PHP.

This site allows a user to login and create a database based on the top 250 movies according to IMDB. 
Users can rate the movie, as well as recommend movies to other users. Once the receiving user has logged in, they will see what movie has been 
recommended for them, and who sent the recommendation. 

Clicking on the movie will direct them to the IMDB site where the user can see more information about the movie including trailers.

# Future updates:

1: Adding Trophy functionality. (I.E. Couch Potato for seeing 10 movies, Movie Buff for see 25.)

2: Using API to update top 250 movies automatically.
