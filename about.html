This is my portfolio where I show all of my work. When I am not programming,				I enjoy golfing, exercising, playing video games, and much more.</p>										<p>I have just completed a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Oregon State University. I enjoy all areas of the technology Industry,				but I am particularly interested in iOS development particuarly using Swift. I have experience with a many languages and development tools 								including Swift, C/C++, Objective-C, HTML, CSS, XCode, Google App Engine, Code::Blocks, and GitHub. I have also used MySQL to create a website that allows individual users to store, track, and 								recommend their favorite movies to other users. The database stores the users information as well as the top 250 movies from IMDB.</p>							<p>	While earning my degree, I was part of different team-based projects giving me real-world experience using an AGILE process.				This gave me the ability to communicate with students from around the globe. I conducted semi-structured interviews, gathered data, produced low and high fidelity prototypes, 								and shared our code to create a complete product.</p>			<p>	Currently, I work as an IT Engineer in a medical office where my responsibilities range from training employees, keeping EHR services up to date, 							as well as troubleshooting any equipment. At this point in my career, I am ready to expand my knowledge beyond IT and branch into software development.				I am very excited for my first job as a software engineer and to become an asset to the technology community.</p>							<p> If you would like to follow me on Twitter, my username is <a href="http://twitter.com/rath3063">@rath3063</a></p>    </section>    <footer>        <!-- <a href="#"><img src="img/twitter-wrap.png" alt="Twitter Logo"                                                   class="social-icon"></a>        <a href="#"><img src="img/facebook-wrap.png" alt="Facebook Logo"                                                         class="social-icon"></a>-->        <a href="https://github.com/Rathnamc"><img src="img/github.png" alt="GitHub Logo"                                                   class="social-icon"></a>        <p>&copy; 2015 Christopher Rathnam.</p>    </footer></div></body></html>
